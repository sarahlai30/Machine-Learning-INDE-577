# What is supervised learning?
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms for accurate data classification or outcome prediction. The model learns from input-output pairs in the training data, enabling it to generalize to new, unseen data. The algorithm evaluates its performance using a loss function and continuously adjusts to minimize prediction errors.

**Algorithms Implemented**

The following supervised learning algorithms are covered in this directory:

* The Perceptron: A basic neural network for binary classification using a linear decision boundary.
* Linear Regression: A regression model that fits a line through data points to predict continuous target values.
* Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm that predicts probabilities for categorical outcomes using a logistic function.
Neural Networks: Multi-layered networks capable of learning complex patterns through backpropagation.
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A classification algorithm that assigns labels based on the majority class of nearby points.
* Decision Trees / Regression Trees: Models that split the data into branches based on feature thresholds for both classification and regression tasks.
* Random Forests: An ensemble of decision trees used to improve model accuracy through bagging.
* Other Ensemble Methods (including Boosting): Algorithms that combine multiple models to reduce variance and bias for better prediction performance.

The datasets used in this directory include:
* Breast Cancer Dataset
  
   The Breast Cancer dataset contains data related to breast cancer tumors, with features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on the features.
* Miles Per Gallon Dataset
  
  The MPG dataset contains information about cars, including fuel efficiency (MPG) and several features related to car design, performance, and origin.
* Banknote Authentication Dataset
  
  The Banknote dataset contains features extracted from images of banknotes using Wavelet Transform. The task is to classify whether a given banknote is authentic (genuine) or fake based on these features.
* Fashion MNIST Dataset
  
  The Fashion MNIST Dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items.
* Movie Datasets
  
  The Movies Dataset contains Movie information, including titles, genres, and release dates and the Ratings Dataset contains user ratings for different movies.
* Iris Dataset
  
  The iris dataset contains information about 3 species of iris flowers and their features.
* Diabetes Dataset
  
  The diabetes dataset contains medical data that relates various physiological features to the progression of diabetes.
* Wine Dataset
  
  The wine dataset contains information about various chemical properties of wine samples, specifically from three different cultivars (types of wine) grown in Italy. The goal is to predict the type of wine based on its chemical composition.
* Digits Dataset

  The Digits Dataset is a classic dataset designed to train and test algorithms for handwritten digit recognition. It is part of the sklearn.datasets module. Each data point represents an image of a digit (0-9) in a 8x8 grayscale grid, flattened into a vector of 64 features.

* California Housing Dataset

  The California Housing Dataset contains information on housing prices in California. It is often used for supervised learning tasks to predict the median house price for different districts in California based on various socioeconomic and geographical features.
