# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on working with data that has no predefined labels or categories. Unlike supervised learning, where the outcomes or classifications are explicitly provided, unsupervised learning algorithms aim to uncover patterns, structures, and relationships within the data independently. This makes it a powerful approach for exploratory data analysis, where the primary objective is to understand the intrinsic structure of the dataset.

In artificial intelligence, unsupervised learning refers to a machine learning paradigm that operates without human-provided labels or supervision. Unlike supervised learning models, which rely on labeled data for training, unsupervised learning models are provided with raw, unlabeled data and tasked with discovering meaningful patterns and insights autonomously, without explicit guidance.

These algorithms analyze and group data by identifying hidden patterns or relationships. The process involves using only the input features of the dataset, allowing the model to independently discover clusters or structures within the data, without being influenced by predefined outcomes or categories.

The algorithms implemented in this directory are:
* K-Means Clustering
* DBSCAN
* Principal Component Analysis
* Image Compression with Singular Value Decompression

The datasets used in the algorithms include:
* Mall Customers

The Mall Customers dataset contains information about customers of a mall and their spending behavior. Variables are CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score (1-100).
* Wine

The Wine dataset contains 13 chemical properties of different wines derived from the same region in Italy, categorized into three classes based on grape varieties.
